# Instructions for setting up Python or Rust CLN Plugin Tutorials on replit.com

Hello!

To create a new repl from this github repo, simply click [this link](https://replit.com/github/chrisguida/cln-plugin-tutorial).

- If you would like to work in **Python**, rename the `.tutorial-python` directory to `.tutorial`, or create a symlink like so:

```sh
ln -s .tutorial-python/ .tutorial
```

- Similarly, if you would like to work in **Rust**:

```sh
ln -s .tutorial-rust/ .tutorial
```

The `.tutorial` directory is what will be displayed in the Replit Tutorial tab.
